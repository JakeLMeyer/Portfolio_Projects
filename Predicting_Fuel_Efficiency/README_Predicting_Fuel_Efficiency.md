## Project Description
This assignment focused on building a Linear Regression model to predict fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) of automobiles. The auto-mpg dataset from Kaggle (UCI Machine Learning) was utilized. The high-level steps within the assignment were prepping the data for the model, creating a correlation coefficient matrix, performing some exploratory data analysis, and training and testing a Linear Regression model. A Lasso Regression model was also trained and tested to compare with evaluation metrics such as R-Squared, RMSE, and MAE.

## Supporting Files
auto-mpg.csv dataset from: [Auto-mpg dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset)

## Project Environment Overview
The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator) via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary Libraries section of the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Removed irrelevant columns, corrected the horsepower column datatype, converted dummy variables for the origin column. 

## Model Training
Split the data into train/test split. Trained and tested a Linear Regression model.

## Model Evaluation
Utilized R-Squared, RMSE, and MAE evaluation metrics.
