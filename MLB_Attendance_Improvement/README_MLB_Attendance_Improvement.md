# MLB Attendance Improvement
Documentation Date: 09/11/2022 <br>
Author: Jake Meyer

## Project Description
The intent for this project was to use data from the Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Team to determine how to improve attendance. The CRISP-DM methodology was followed for this analysis. The assignment portrays Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), training/testing of a Linear Regression model, evaluation metrics to compare a model trained with reduced features, and recommended actions based on the insights gleaned.

## Supporting Files
The CSV file for the Dodger's attendance data is provided in the repository link - [dodgers-2022.csv](http://localhost:8889/edit/Documents/Github/Portfolio_Projects/MLB_Attendance_Improvement/dodgers-2022.csv)

## Project Environment Overview
The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator) via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary Libraries section of the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Categorical features were converted to dummy variables.

## Model Training
Train/Test split was performed on the data. Also applied PCA on standardized data to reduce the features down from 75 to 28. Linear Regression Model was trained and tested.

## Model Evaluation
R-Squared, Adj. R-Squared, RMSE, and MAE were utilized for the evaluation metrics. In the future, I would revisit the predictive modeling options as well as the PCA applied to the data to improve the performance.
