# Image Classification
Documentation Date: 04/23/2023 <br>
Author: Jake Meyer

## Project Description
There were a few parts to this assignment, but the focus was classifying images with Neural Networks. The first part of the assignment focused on classifying digits from the MNIST digit data set. A CNN model was trained with the image data and evaluated for accuracy and loss plots. A second part of this assignment consisted of creating a CNN model to classify images of different objects using CIFAR10 small images classification data set. This was performed with and without data-augmentation. Lastly, the ResNet 50 model was used to perform image classification on images personally chosen for the assignment.

## Supporting Files
Using code from [deep-learning-with-python-notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks) <br>
Data came from the MNIST digit dataset.

## Project Environment Overview
The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator) via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary Libraries section of the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Digit classification - Reshaped and normalized the training and test images. The labels were converted to numbers. <br>
Image classification - Normalized the training and test images. The labels were converted to numbers. <br>

## Model Training
Split the data into train/test subsets. A CNN was instantiated and a classifier was added onto the CNN. 

## Model Evaluation
Training and Validation accuracy plots were generated to show the model performance. In addition, Training and Validation Loss plots were utilized to understand model performance.
