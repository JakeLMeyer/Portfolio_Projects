# Movie Recommender System
Documentation Date: 11/01/2022 <br>
Author: Jake Meyer

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a recommender system using the small MovieLens data set. Users could input a movie they like, and the recommender system will output 10 other recommendations to watch. The highlights from this project include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), consolidating a data frame based on correlation values, and providing an output summary of recommendations based on the userâ€™s movie input.

## Supporting Files
Movie Lens Data Set (Small) - [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## Project Environment Overview
The project was completed in Jupyter Notebook (through Anaconda Navigator) via Python. All relevant libraries are called out in the Import Necessary Libraries section of the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Merged the df_ratings and df_movies dataframes together. Structured the dataframe so it could be grouped by a movie input and output the top movies to recommend based on correlation value.

## Model Training
Receive input from the user and sort the dataframe based on correlation value. 

## Model Evaluation
Correlation value was the main metric for the recommender system.
